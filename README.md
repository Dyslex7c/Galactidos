## Geospatial Game Creation - Satellite Image Guessing Challenge

The challenge is to design and develop an interactive geospatial game where
participants guess the real‐world location based on satellite images of the area. Similar to
popular games like
Geoguessr, this game aims to promote geospatial awareness and
problem‐solving skills while making learning about the world's geography fun and engaging.

The user analyses satellite imagery generated randomly from a collection and tries to guess
the location of the image. The game is designed to hone the visual/analytical skills of the
player in correspondence to geographical knowledge.
